# kuser
Every few months I decide to get a bit more organized on my Windows equivalents to
.profile and it's cousins. And I usually don't actually get organized. I'm trying
once more.
 
While most of this is fairly boring, there may be a useful tidbit here or there. I've
finally made the cut to _primarily_ (as opposed to _exclusively_) using PowerShell
as my main command line shell. In making this switch, there have been little items
that I found I can't live without from my CMD console. Some of that has found it's
way into my PS common profile.

Worth noting that the 'initial' push is from my least evolved profile, so it will be
thin until I add in what I have on my laptop and other sources.

## Interesting tidbits
YMMV, but here's what I think may be of interest to someone.
(in PSprofile/common.PowerShell_profile.ps1)
* Add-ToEnvPath
* Set-LocationHelper , see it's use in aliases.ps. I use these shortcuts constantly.
